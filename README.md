# Dancer

A reconfigurable Konata Dancer

Allows changing the GIF, song, and other settings


# Instructions
    - Place wanted GIFs in the *GIFs* folder
    - Place wanted songs in the *music* folder
    - Right-click on icon in tray (the ^ on the right side of the taskbar) to pull up options
Settings you change for a certain GIF (including the song) will automatically save and be reapplied when reopening that GIF


# TODO / known issues:
    - [ X ] Improve UI of music selection
        - [ XOX ] Allow listening to 5 second sample?
            - For now just letting listen indefinitely
    - [  ] Allow changing size of Dancer
        - Add to 'window' portion of gifs section of settings.json (in format WIDTHxHEIGHT)
    - [ X ] Fix hide functionality
        - Toggle functionality was flipped (i.e. tried making it visible when it should be hidden)
    - [ X ] Allow adjusting transparency amount
        - Slider from 0%->100%
        - Similar for Shadow and Gif_Speed now as well
    - [  ] Test as an executable and as an Ubuntu app
